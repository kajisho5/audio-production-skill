# Build the release notes for this version and prepend them to CHANGELOG.md, reading every piece of
# commit/PR text through `git log` at runtime. Nothing here interpolates `${{ github.event.* }}` (or
# any other untrusted text) into a shell script: that is the known GitHub Actions script-injection
# pattern (a PR title containing e.g. `$(curl ...)` or backticks, spliced in via `${{ }}`, becomes
# part of the script *before* the shell parses it). Reading the same text back out via `git log`
# instead makes it plain data: it is only ever assigned to a variable or redirected into a file, never
# re-evaluated as code.
#
# Inputs (environment): NEXT_VERSION (required), LATEST_TAG (optional; empty = first release).
# Output: overwrites ./release_notes.md (the range's log, used as the GitHub Release body and as this
# version's CHANGELOG.md entry) and prepends the same entry to ./CHANGELOG.md (created if missing).
