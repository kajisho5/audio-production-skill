# Write NEXT_VERSION into every file that carries this repo's version number, and (repo-specific,
# see CLAUDE.md) regenerate the pinned contract snapshot so CI's `contract --check` does not fail on
# the very next run: `version` is one of contract_check.py's PINNED_BLOCKS, so it is part of what
# tests/contract/contract.json commits to, and it changes on every bump -- auto or manual.
#
# A no-op (exit 0, nothing written) when CURRENT_VERSION already equals NEXT_VERSION: the "manual"
# path in compute_version.sh means a human already edited these files (and, per that same CLAUDE.md
# rule, already regenerated the snapshot) as part of the merged PR; touching them again here would
# just be a needless empty commit.
#
# Set REGENERATE_CONTRACT=1 to also run `audio-production contract --json > tests/contract/contract.json`
# (requires the package installed, i.e. `pip install -e .` already ran); the release workflow sets it,
# the isolated fixture test does not (it never installs this real package).
