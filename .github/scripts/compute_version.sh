# Decide the version this push should release, without ever executing untrusted text: every value
# either comes from `git` (read at runtime, never spliced into a workflow `run:` block via `${{ }}`)
# or from the trusted `resolved-version` output of release-drafter's dry run.
#
# Rule (see CLAUDE.md / docs/STATE.md "release automation"):
#   - auto-bump fires ONLY when pyproject.toml's current version already equals the latest release
#     tag. In that case the next version is whatever release-drafter's dry run resolved from the
#     labels of PRs merged since that tag (default: patch when a merged PR carries no version label).
#   - otherwise (no tag yet, or the version was already bumped by hand ahead of the last tag) the
#     current pyproject.toml version is respected as-is and released unchanged: this is what makes a
#     manual version bump in a merged PR (this repo's own convention for a breaking contract change,
#     see CLAUDE.md "Rules for changes") stick instead of being overwritten by an automatic bump.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   CURRENT_VERSION           required; from pyproject.toml, e.g. "0.3.0"
#   DRAFTER_RESOLVED_VERSION  release-drafter's dry-run `resolved-version` output; only read when
#                             the auto-bump branch is taken. May be unset/empty otherwise.
#
# Output: writes `next_version`, `latest_tag`, `mode` (auto|manual) and `should_release` (true|false)
# to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set, and always prints them as `key=value` lines on stdout so this script is
# runnable and checkable standalone (see tests/README under the fixture used to verify it).
